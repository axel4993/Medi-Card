# Medi-Card
How many times have we gone helter shelter searching for our medical history files before a doctor’s appointment? Even more so in case of emergencies when we are not very sure about the entire medical history of the patient and having these files handy becomes a necessity. Well, the struggle ends here with this handy and compact alternative that our team has come up with. All you have to do is to carry the “Medi-card”. The card can be scanned at the hospital through our app giving the doctor access to the entire medical history of the patient and the current list of medication the patient is on. The app also includes a unique feature wherein you can scan the barcode of the medicine being used thereby giving you all the information about that medication- from its contents to what ailments its used to treat ,side-effects etc. So no more doubts on medicine composition versus knowing just the brand name and trying to figure out what it is being prescribed for. With Medicard, say goodbye to your struggle with files …enjoy the benefit of just carrying the card with you always in your wallet – within hands reach
